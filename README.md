## The Dataset

- Image Classification with Deep Learning 


For each problem, we have provided a dataset.  You are highly encouraged to use the provided dataset, but you may use an alternative dataset of your own choosing, pending instructor approval.

Like Project \#3, the focus here is on *prediction*. It will be up to you to determine how best to evaluate your model, but for any of these projects you should imagine that your goal is to build something that **works**.  If you invest in poorly chosen ZIP codes, this will hurt the business. If you make poor movie recommendations, people will stop trusting your judgments.  And the seriousness of the consequences of mis-classifying pneumonic or non-pneumonic lungs goes without saying! 

When choosing a problem, consider:

1. **Portfolio Depth:** One option is to choose the same type of problem you plan to tackle in Module 5 (capstone).  This will allow you to practice the necessary skills in a group setting, before diving into your individual project.  You will likely produce a capstone project that is more polished and sophisticated, but your portfolio will demonstrate less breadth.
2. **Portfolio Breadth:** Another option is to choose a type of problem that interests you, but that you don't plan to use in your capstone project.  Each of your individual projects will end up less polished and sophisticated, but you will end up with a portfolio that demonstrates a wider range of skills.


### Problem 3: Image Classification with Deep Learning

If you choose this option, you'll put everything you've learned together to build a deep neural network that trains on a large dataset for classification on a non-trivial task.  In this case, using x-ray images of pediatric patients to identify whether or not they have pneumonia.  The dataset comes from Kermany et al. on [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3), although there is also a version on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) that may be easier to use.

Your task is to:

> Build a model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia, given a chest x-ray image. 

#### Aim for a Proof of Concept

With Deep Learning, data is king -- the more of it, the better. However, the goal of this project isn't to build the best model possible -- it's to demonstrate your understanding by building a model that works. You should try to avoid datasets and model architectures that won't run in reasonable time on your own machine. For many problems, this means downsampling your dataset and only training on a portion of it. Once you're absolutely sure that you've found the best possible architecture and other hyperparameters for your model, then consider training your model on your entire dataset overnight (or, as larger portion of the dataset that will still run in a feasible amount of time).

At the end of the day, we want to see your thought process as you iterate and improve on a model. A project that achieves a lower level of accuracy but has clearly iterated on the model and the problem until it found the best possible approach is more impressive than a model with high accuracy that did no iteration. We're not just interested in seeing you finish a model -- we want to see that you understand it, and can use this knowledge to try and make it even better!

#### Evaluation

Evaluation is fairly straightforward for this project.  But you'll still need to think about which metric to use and about how best to cross-validate your results.



## The Deliverables

For online students, your completed project should contain the following four deliverables:

1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to a public GitHub repository dedicated for this project.

2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository. 

3. A **_[Blog Post](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging-v2-1)_**.

4. An **_"Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation_** that gives a brief overview of your problem/dataset, and each step of the OSEMN process.

Note: On-campus students may have different deliverables, please speak with your instructor.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:

**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  

**_Process, Methodology, and Findings_**

* Your notebook should contain a clear record of your process and methodology for exploring and preprocessing your data, building and tuning a model, and interpreting your results.
* We recommend you use the OSEMN process to help organize your thoughts and stay on track.


### Visualizations

As usual, the best way to present findings is often visually, and the tips and reminders below should apply to any of these projects.

But please pay special attention to this section if choosing Project \#1 because time series analysis is an area of data science that lends itself well to intuitive data visualizations. Whereas we may not be able to visualize the best choice in a classification or clustering problem with a high-dimensional dataset, that isn't an issue with time series data. As such, **_any findings worth mentioning in this problem are probably also worth visualizing_**.

Your notebook should make use of data visualizations as appropriate to make your findings obvious to any readers. And, when it comes to moving images out of notebooks, make an effort to *export* them rather than taking screen shots. Note e.g. `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()`, an in-built exportation tool. See [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/export-images-from-jupyter-notebook-with-a-single-command-422db2b66e92) for more sophisticated possibilities.

Remember that if a visualization is worth creating, then it's also worth taking the extra few minutes to make sure that it is easily understandable and well-formatted. When creating visualizations, make sure that they have:

* A title
* Clearly labeled X and Y axes, with appropriate scale for each
* A legend, when necessary
* No overlapping text that makes it hard to read
* An intelligent use of color -- multiple lines should have different colors and/or symbols to make them easily differentiable to the eye
* An appropriate amount of information -- avoid creating graphs that are "too busy". For instance, don't create a line graph with 25 different lines on it.

## The Process

These steps are informed by Smart Vision's<sup>1</sup> description of the CRISP-DM process.

### 1. Business Understanding

Start by reading this document, and making sure that you understand the kinds of questions being asked.  In order to narrow your focus, you will likely want to make some design choices about your specific audience, rather than attempting to address all potentially-relevant concerns. Think about what kinds of predictions you want to be able to make, and about which kinds of wrong predictions are most concerning.

Three things to be sure you establish during this phase are:

1. **Objectives:** what questions are you trying to answer, and for whom?
2. **Project plan:** you may want to establish more formal project management practices, such as daily stand-ups or using a Trello board, to plan the time you have remaining.  Regardless you should determine the division of labor, communication expectations, and timeline.
3. **Success criteria:** what does a successful project look like?  How will you know when you have achieved it?  At this point you should be able to establish at least one quantitative success metric, before you even decide on which model(s) you are going to try.

### 2. Data Understanding

Write a script to download the data (or instructions for future users on how to manually download it), and explore it.  Do you understand what the columns mean?  If the dataset has more than one table, how do they relate to each other?  How will you select the subset of relevant data?  What kind of data cleaning is required?

It may be useful to generate visualizations of the data during this phase.

### 3. Data Preparation

Through SQL and Pandas, perform any necessary data cleaning and develop a query that pulls in all relevant data for modeling, including any merging of tables.  Be sure to document any data that you choose to drop or otherwise exclude.  This is also the phase to consider any feature scaling or one-hot encoding required to feed the data into your particular model.

### 4. Modeling

Similar to the Mod 3 project, the focus is on prediction. Good prediction is a matter of the model generalizing well. Steps we can take to assure good generalization include: testing the model on unseen data, cross-validation, and regularization. What sort of model should you build?

Here you will also likely encounter problems with computational capacity.  Figure out how to use smaller samples of your data in order to tweak hyperparameters.  Investigate cloud tools with hardware acceleration (e.g. Google Colab is a free one) in order to run your analysis with larger sets of data and more versions of the model.

### 5. Evaluation

Recall that there are many different metrics we might use for evaluating a classification model. Accuracy is intuitive, but can be misleading, especially if you have class imbalances in your target. Perhaps, depending on you're defining things, it is more important to minimize false positives, or false negatives. It might therefore be more appropriate to focus on precision or recall. You might also calculate the AUC-ROC to measure your model's *discrimination*.

### 6. Deployment

In this case, your "deployment" comes in the form of the deliverables listed above. Make sure you can answer the following questions about your process:

 - "How did you pick the question(s) that you did?"
 - "Why are these questions important from a business perspective?"
 - "How did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?"
 - "Why did you choose a given method or library?"
 - "Why did you select these visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?"
 - "Why did you pick those features as predictors?"
 - "How would you interpret the results?"
 - "How confident are you in the predictive quality of the results?"
 - "What are some of the things that could cause the results to be wrong?"
